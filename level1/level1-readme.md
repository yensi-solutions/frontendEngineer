## Coding Test Instructions

Please follow the instructions below to complete the coding test using ReactJS with TypeScript:

1. Create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript:

2. Use EmployeeList.png as a guide to create a view that displays a list of employees. The end result should be exactly as the image.

3. Use `data.ts` file located in the project directory. This file contains the data that you will need to build the view.

4. Breakdown the view into components as needed. You can create additional components if necessary.

5. Test your implementation manually and ensure that the view is displayed correctly.

6. Take a screenshot of your result and include it in the project directory.

7. Create a zip folder excluding the `node_modules` directory. The zip folder should contain the project files, the screenshot, and the `data.ts` file. The zip folder should be named `<your name>-FE1-level1.zip`.

8. Share the zip folder with the hiring team for review.

9. Include additional details in the README.md file. Answer the following questions:
    1. Why you chose a particular approach, what you would do differently if you had more time.
    2. How long did you spend on this test?
    3. What did you find most difficult?

Good luck with the coding test! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
